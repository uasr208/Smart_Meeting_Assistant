# About Me

**Name:** Utkarsh Arun
**Role:** Senior Full-Stack Engineer / AI Architect

I am a high-performance engineer with a **10 CGPA** discipline, specializing in bridging the gap between AI-driven velocity and architectural robustness. My focus is on building "Founder-level" software—applications that are not just code complete, but product-ready, resilient, and scalable from Day 1.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- **Architect for Resilience**: Implementing "Offline First" strategies that degrade gracefully without breaking user experience.
- **Agentic Workflow**: Leveraging advanced AI agents (Google Antigravity) to perform deep refactoring and state synchronization.
- **Product Polish**: delivering UI/UX that builds trust (System Health dashboards, transparent sync states).
